New Zealand fans, I hope you're all sleeping already instead of reading this and maybe look forward to the next game - the last of the series - on 2nd February (no pressure). Indian fans, great start to your weekend, it can only get worse from here. It's goodbye and good luck from Vishal Dikshit and Shashank Kishore...Ciao!\n\n<b>Presentation</b> now:\n\n<b>Kohli</b>: There's something new I've learnt in the last couple of games: when the opposition is playing well, you stay calm till the end and try to come back. We couldn't have asked for more exciting games, we've never played Super Overs before and now we've won two. It shows the character of the team. Initially we thought of opening with Samson and KL in the Super Over, but then KL told me I should bat because of the experience and the options I'll bring. His two strikes were crucial and then you knock the ball into the gap and takes your team over the line. Sanju was fearless at the top of the order, we didn't quite read the pitch that well. He tried to take the momentum away, he should back himself. Saini was impressive with his pace again. We were very proud with the way we went about it.\n\n<b>Southee</b>: It's very tough especially in the positions we put ourselves into. We have them a chance and they took them with both hands. We have a young bowling attack and, it is tough, \nwhen you haven't won and you play against a quality opposition in India, give them a sniff and make it tough for yourselves. \n\n\n<b>Thakur is the Man of the Match</b>: I'm feeling good, we play for such nail-biting finishes, we couldn't have asked for anything more in these two games. After the last game we learnt that we should never lose hope. The wicket on the first ball of the last over was crucial because it made them nervous. Good contribution from me with the bat, I should have carried on and hopefully I'll get more next time\n\n<b>12.12am</b> Kohli celebrates with his right arm punching the air, Samson joins him and they walk off the field to be hugged by Manish Pandey first up, the man who turned the match around for India. How New Zealand have managed to fluff this up again is beyond me and everyone, I guess! 11 to win off 12, seven to win from the last over with Taylor and an in-form Seifert out there and they both manage to get out in the first three balls of the over. India kept missing their direct hits too throughout the innings but Rahul didn't miss in the last over, he ran Seifert out, did the needful on the last ball to collect the throw and took it to the Super Over to then hit a six on the first ball in the chase. India will be thrilled to snatch these wins in the last two matches, not letting NZ win first, and then chasing it down with different batsmen in both games. New Zealand, what do I say...they have lots to think about and discuss about how to fight back, how to go over the line in the last over, and, well, how not to lose Super Overs. We'll get you the presentation once things start making sense again...","hasVideoId":false},{"timeStamp":0.4,"text":"Southee to Kohli, 2 runs, Kohli has tapped this back of length bal towards mid-on, most of the fielders are deep so Southee has to go after it.
